          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable</li>
          <li>String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.</li>
          <li>Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
          <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>Operator: a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Conditionals: Code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>

          <li>Array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
